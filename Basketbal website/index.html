                        The game of basketball will never again be what it used to be. There will
                        never again be players like Pete Maravich, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, or 
                        Michael Jordan. These players played simply for the fact that they loved 
                        the game of basketball. They came out every night and gave everything 
                        they could to win. They played with heart. They played with emotion. They  
                        weren't complaining about how many millions of dollars they thought they 
                        deserved, they just wanted to play.
